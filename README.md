# LuaCC - The Lua Compiler Compiler written in C
## Completely rewritten as of 6/3/25!
LuaCC is a compiler which compiles Lua bytecode to assembly, which can be assembled & linked into machine code. Pretty useful, if you ask me
***WARNING: If you see unsafe code (such as freeing freed memory, undefined behavior or forgetting to free memory), PLEASE MAKE AN ISSUE!!***

## Usage
```
luacc [options] input file(s)
```
e.g. `luacc -o assembly.asm bytecode.lua`

## Compilation
compilation instructions coming soon

## Why LuaCC?
to learn, and why not???
